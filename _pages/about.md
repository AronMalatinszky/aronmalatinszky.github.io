I'm a predoctoral research fellow at J-PAL North America, where I assist the research of Professor Amy Finkelstein. 
I graduated from Boston University in May 2020 with a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics and a M.A. in Economics. 
My passions include academic economic research, any kind of problem-solving, skiing, cycling, learning languages (be it foreign or programming), and spending time with my family.
  
I'm currently applying for PhD programs in the US with research interests in:
- Economics of education
- Labor economics
- Public finance
