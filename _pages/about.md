I'm a Ph.D. student in economics at Boston University. Previously, I was a predoctoral research fellow at J-PAL North America.
I graduated from Boston University in May 2020 with a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics and a M.A. in Economics. 
My passions include academic economic research, any kind of problem-solving, skiing, cycling, and spending time with my family.
  
My main research interests lie in:
- Economics of education
- Labor economics
- Public finance
